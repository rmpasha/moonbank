moonbank is a linear app where each astronaut can mint 10 moonbucks.
Subsequently they are able to spend 9 of them and have 1 remaining as a souvenir from their time on the moon.

moonbank was created for the 2018 Consensys Academy Developers Program.
Although I was unable to finish the test cases the app should work as follows:

1) Click the "Clone or download" button to save a copy locally.

2) Open up terminal and CD to the directory where the folder is saved.

3) Input "truffle compile" in terminal

4) Open up ganache

5) Input "truffle migrate" in terminal

6) Input "npm run start" in terminal

7) The app should start.

Changing accounts and refreshing the page should allow the user to start from the beginning of the app.
The app should continue to update balances accordingly. This app uses metamask. Please clear accounts before using them on metamask to avoid network artifacts.
